# MCTSExtend 

* Main code is present in mctsExtend 
* Tests contains unit test.
* Competitors holds the code of beam_search, misere, and an exhaustive one that we created to access the ground truth (see experiments of paper)
* Finally, xp folder hold the code for experiments. In other\_xp\_results, we added some experiments with different parameters to show that the behaviour is the same (changing k in top-k, time budget or dataset, etc).
